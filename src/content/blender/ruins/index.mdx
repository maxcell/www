Here's the final version of what I made!

![Finished piece of the ancient ruins. Has a nighttime glow with chipped stairs and a river flowing through](../../../assets/8_final_ruins.png)

![The first image with no color just stairs and ruin](../../../assets/0_detailing_ruin_and_stairs.png)
![Added sun light with pillars](../../../assets/1_sun_lighting_ruin.png)
![Added more detail with a river flowing through and more detailing of the stairs](../../../assets/2_added_terrain_different_angle.png)
![Added more trees and shrubbery and rocks](../../../assets/3_plants.png)
![Added a waterfall and river](../../../assets/4_water.png)
![Added vines onto the pillars](../../../assets/5_colorless_ruins.png)
![Gave everything color and started to make glyphs that were iridescent](../../../assets/6_nice_ruins_glyph.png)
![Added a new angle that was higher up to shoot down but everything is still in color](../../../assets/7_my_lighting_ruins.png)
