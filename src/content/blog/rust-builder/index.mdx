A pattern that I've noticed in working with [Serenity][gh-serenity] is the
**Builder Pattern**. This is a type of creational design pattern which means that
it is a way to handle creating data within a given system. The Builder Pattern is
can be helpful in a case of where you need to construct an object with a lot of
parameters that may enhance the object but aren't necessarily required.

Here is a simplified example of a builder:





## Conclusion

I've been learning more and more about Rust and one of the things I think is part
of the learning journey for any programming language is to identify common patterns.
These patterns help communicate intention of the software to other developers and
help also make it easier to identify areas where you may want to enhance logic.
