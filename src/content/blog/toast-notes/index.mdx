### Netlify Build Error due to Caching

Current problem that exists within Toast right now (2020-12-05) is that the binary isn't
cached for us by Netlify. So when they try to go back and rebuild the site they fail because
the binary isn't stuffed away.

The error would look something like this:

```bash
$ yarn build:css && yarn incremental
$ postcss --config postcss-config src/styles/style.css -o public/style.css
$ toast incremental .
Error: spawnSync /opt/buildhome/.config/toast-nodejs/0.3.30/bin/toast ENOENT
    at Object.spawnSync (internal/child_process.js:1066:20)
```

To solve for something like this **temporarily** is to do work in the postinstall
to make sure that we always have the binary available. With the postinstall method
we unfortunately also run the risk of losing traction from other package managers.
This could also be solved through using a Netlify plugin but this wouldn't be as ergonomic.

The more permanent solve requires the developers of Toast to find a way to make sure
that the binary can be cached/available for Netlify.

### Breadbox failing to build a file within a package

Snowpack is looking for packages it needs to build up but it does this by going through
all sorts of folders, and one folder we **do not** want it to look into is the `public/`
folder so if anything gets breadboxed for us, we don't want to breadbox that thing as well.

```shell
⠼ snowpack installing... preact, preact/compat, preact/hooks, preact/hooks.js
✖ Cannot find module '/.../prince-toast/node_modules/preact/hooks.js'
```

To avoid this issue, you need to make sure to go to your `package.json` and in the `snowpack`
configuration add in the public folder:

```diff
"snowpack": {
    "knownEntrypoints": [
      "preact",
      "preact/hooks",
      "@mdx-js/preact"
    ],
    "exclude": [
+      "public/**/*",
      "toast.js",
      "data/fetch-mdx-post-files.js"
    ],
  // Rest of the file ...
}
```
