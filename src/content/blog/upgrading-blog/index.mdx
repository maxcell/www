To get a bit better for my blog, decided to get on a few new pieces of technology:
- MDX - https://mdxjs.com/
- ThemeUI - https://theme-ui.com/
- emotion https://emotion.sh/docs/emotion#cx

When using MDX for my Code Blocks I needed to use PrismReactRenderer (https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#code)

Also needed to know how my inline code was working https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#inlinecode

Found this nifty code to add my pre-existing theme https://github.com/filoxo/blog/commit/3862bb4f5f5d4ebfafa3f773b7c1687fc8ca5bea https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/issues/26
