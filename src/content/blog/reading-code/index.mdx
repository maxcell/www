title: "Reading More Code to Writing Better Code"

There was wisdom shared back on Friday, May 7th that really didn't make
sense with me until I started reflecting back on my week this week.
[Scott Hanselman][scott-hanselman] shared this paraphrased statement in
a Developer Education Twitter Space:

> One of the arts [...] is getting really good at reading through code.
> You have to get comfortable in reading a large codebase. I'd say it
> is just as important as writing code.

And at first, I was thinking to myself, "Does that mean I need to be
reading a library written by some developers and has so many files?"
I can't possibly do that! The reason I reacted that way
though was because I felt exceptionally overwhelmed with that idea.
However, throughout the day I realized that it doesn't have to look like
that whatsoever. Earlier in my day job I realized I had already learned
this lesson through a teammate.

### Code Reviews can be for Learning Too

I work on building tools for other developers at my company. A lot of
what I have been trying to improve on for myself is building the right
APIs for other people. I like to think of how can I make something
predictable while also affording some ergonomics of the tool. I have
wonderful teammates who I can always learn from about this too.

A teammate added new code for a rich text editor and it was just some
of the coolest code to read to me because it showed how to write different
abstractions and why we would want them at certain levels. It wasn't
how I thought about approaching the problem and it was enlightening to see how
they decided to break apart logic.

Most of the time in my PR reviews I am making sure to check for any
changes we might need to make but also I take it as a time to think
about what patterns can I learn here.

Sometimes it is look things like specializing a component: We had a
`<Button/>` component and they made it specialized for the rich text
editor so it could afford things like accessible keyboard navigation
and I thought it was so cool to see how we could allow for things to
be swapped out and also be potentially useful for different underlying
text editors.

Sometimes it looks like updating pre-existing code: Most of our code is
written for a primary set of usecases. It was cool to see them take a
function we had made for a special case of only listening to the document
and switching the API seamlessly to accept an element optionally while
also setting the default behavior.

The things about these two examples though is I was already familiar
with the syntax to do both of them. It is learning and understand the
patterns they decided to choose and seeing them in application. I think
that's really what a Pull Request can afford you to understand if you
look deeper at it.

### Where Do I Want To Go From Here?

I think what this really showed me though is my focus of wanting to
get better at API Design can really be closer than I realize and I have
to be able to see the lessons that are in front of me. I don't have to
reach for some prime example repo and spend endless hours studying it
but can be taking it at the micro even and just examining a conversation
or PR of the past and slowly piecing together the rationale.

In my PRs I can examine why did I design it a certain way or even ask
for advice on the design before it is merged. I think this goes back to
[Chris Biscardi's newsletter][chris-newsletter] too:

> Taking a step back and then reviewing your own code critically \[...\]
> There's the good reason that it gives more direction and context to
> other reviewers to help the end product even better and also
> 
> It develops empathy.

I think the most important an actionable step for me is
playing as a code anthropologist and documenting these things
as I learn them. And not in the sense of "I MUST name this pattern"
but rather understanding how it came to be and why and when would it be
appropriate to consider -- what tradeoffs come with the abstraction.
