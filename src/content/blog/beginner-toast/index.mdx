I will never be able to do it justice to explain, so here is 
a tagline from the Toast [site](https://toast.dev):

> Toast is an ES Modules based Jamstack framework for prebuilding large sites.

Toast is powered by Rustlang but all we will have to do is write our
familiar JavaScript code.

We're going to build a small site through this. If you're a person 
who likes to read code or want to see the finished result, feel free
to take a gander at this repository.

## Prerequisites

One of the most important prerequisites is that the minimum required 
Node version is the latest version of Node v14. I'd recommend 
installing it through a tool like [nvm][nvm] so you can have multiple
Node versions on your system.

I'd also recommend having the package manager [Yarn][yarn].


## The Smallest Example of a Toast Site

Let's init our project in a new project directory, I call mine `toast-example`:

```text
yarn init toast-example
```

You can let it default all the way down if you'd like!

We will want to add the two packages necessary for any Toast site:

1. `@sector/breadbox` - handles converting any packages to be ESModule
2. `toast` - the secret sauce

You can add them to your dependencies with:

```text
yarn add @sector/breadbox toast
```

Lastly for the `package.json` you will want to add the line:

```json {5}
// in toast-example/package.json
{
  "name": "toast-example",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  // ...
}
```

We'll also add some scripts in our `package.json` so we can
easily run any commands we will need.

```json {5-8}
// in toast-example/package.json
{
  // ...
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "breadbox": "breadbox --dest public/web_modules",
    "build": "toast incremental ."
  },
  // ...
}
```

From there, we can now write some code!

By default, Toast will look for `.js` files in a `src/pages` directory. It will take those pages and convert them into HTML
files so if I have a file named `beef.js` it will convert to a
`beef.html` file.

```jsx
// inside src/pages/beef.js
import { h, Fragment } from 'preact';

export default function Beef() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>Here is our beef page</h1>
      <p>You can write whatever you want here</p>
    </Fragment>
  )
}
```

A few things to notice here:

- By default, Toast uses Preact, this is to be conservative with size
one brings to their user but still provides similar ergonomics like React.
- When we write our file, we want to be sure to `import {h} from 'preact'`.
This makes sure that the correct pragma is set.
- The page will be built off of the default export of your file. So,
we can write other components but we want to be sure we have a default set.


### Build steps for a Toast site

Now that we have our first page, how do we build our site?

It is composed of two steps:

1. `breadbox --dest public/web_modules`
2. `toast incremental .`

The first step makes our web modules. TODO: EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANs.
The second does the actual processing for our site and converting our pages over. Remember we made these scripts already so we can
now run them: `yarn run breadbox && yarn build`.

You'll see a folder of everything built in a new folder `public`.

### Viewing your Pages in the Browser

You can use any tool to host a local server of the `public` folder.
I tend to just install `http-server` as a devDependency (`yarn add --dev http-server)` and then run `http-server public` which will launch at on localhost:8080. Since we didn't create a `index` page, we won't see anything at the root. But let's go to [http://localhost:8080/beef](http://localhost:8080/beef) and voila!
