A lot of Twitch programming streams have all sorts 
of fun interactive ways to engage their chat. I have
always found them so fun so I wanted to build my own!
While this example is going to be going over command
activated stuff, feel free to take a look at the rest
of the possibilities with [ComfyJS][comfyjs].

### Prerequisite

Here are some things to consider:

- You'll want to have your Twitch handle for the chat to listen to
- A way to have [ComfyJS][comfyjs] availalbe (I'll use the CDN)
- A way to host the site we create, where I use [Netlify](#)

### Creating the Site

Let's create a skeleton HTML file in our project folder 
(I name my project folder, `obs-browser-source`).
We should name this file `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Inside of obs-browser-source/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>If you're not OBS, Go Away</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/comfy.js@latest/dist/comfy.min.js"></script>
  <style>
    <!-- We will declare some styles here soon -->
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <!-- We will write the body in just a second! -->
</body>
</html>
```

This skeleton HTML file helps set up a small website! For our website,
you'll see a set of `<head>` and `<body>` tags. We will start with the
writing in the body so we can get started:

```html
<body>
  <img id="ferris" src="./rustacean-flat-happy.png" width="200" />
  <script>
    ComfyJS.onCommand = (user, command, message, flags, extra) => {
      if (command === "yeeclaw") {
        const ferris = document.getElementById("ferris")
        ferris.classList.add("rotate")
        setTimeout(() => {
          ferris.classList.remove("rotate")
        }, 1000)
      }
    }

    ComfyJS.Init("maxcellw");
  </script>
</body>
```

We start by adding our image, I have this cute little photo of [Ferris the Rustacean](#).
Then we will directly write our JavaScript directly into the HTML file within `<script>` tags.
This can be done in a separate file if you want, but just make sure to link it properly with
the `src` attribute.

Inside of our script, we will use our `ComfyJS.onCommand` which helps register actions,
whenever we listen for a command in the chat. By default the command flag it looks for is `!`.
So whenever someone in our chat starts a message with `!` it will indicate to ComfyJS that this
is a command and we should be using this function.

From there we can indicate the name of the command we want to listen for, so `!yeeclaw`. From there,
we tell our program to find the image on our site, add a `class` and then remove it after a second.

Last for the body tag is initializing ComfyJS with the username of the chat we want to listen to!
So in my case I added my handle, [maxcellw](https://twitch.tv/maxcellw). Feel free to replace it with yours!

Now that is done, let's add what effect we want to happen. In our command, we'll be adding
a class to our image that causes it to spin. Experiment, the web browser is your oyster!

```html
<style>
  .rotate {
    animation: rotation 1s 1 linear;
  }

  @keyframes rotation {
    from {
      transform: rotate(0deg);
    }

    to {
      transform: rotate(359deg);
    }
  }
</style>
```

Now if we open our `index.html` file in the browser, we will see our little Ferris sitting along. And
whenever we type our command into the chat, we will see it spin!

Here is an example:

### Deploying our Site to Netlify

- Have a netlify account
- Have Netlify CLI
- `ntl deploy --prod`

### Add Site to OBS as browser source

- Add new object to scene, Browse source
- Name it
- Take netlify URL and use that as URL
- Adjust on scene
- Test with command
