<p class="text-lg pt-2">
	Howdy! I'm Prince Wilson, but you can call me Prince. I am a person who cares about making
	better communities one step at a time. Whether it is through giving talks at meetups/conferences,
	or building and securing technology to make people's lives better.
	</p>
<p class="text-lg pt-2">
	In my last role, I was a Senior Software Engineer on the Developer Experience team for  <a class="text-lg text-purple-700 underline" href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>.
	Before that, I helped build components for the Design Systems at <a class="text-lg text-purple-700 underline" href="https://newsela.com">Newsela</a>. And was a software engineer over at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, powered by <a class="text-lg text-purple-700 underline" href="https://wework.com/">WeWork</a>.
		I started off as an instructor there and helped over 400 folks transition into a career of technology!
	</p>
<p class="text-lg pt-2">
	I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a focus in security over at the University of Central Florida. Back in school, I founded our tech club with a bunch of my friends,
		known as Tech Knights. We also created our first intercollegiate hackathon known as <a class="text-lg text-purple-700 underline" href="https://knighthacks.org/">Knight Hacks</a>.
	</p>
<p class="text-lg pt-2">
	Now, I enjoy exploring New York City! I look for opportunities to give back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorship and open source.
	But most of all, I really really love corgis.
