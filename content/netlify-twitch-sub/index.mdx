title: 'Creating a Twitch launched Netlify function'

description: 'When we want to point our blog posts somewhere else or have our own short links to places, we can use Netlify redirects to point to them!'

Outline:
- Create a function in `netlify/functions/some_name.js`
- Function should handle two things
  - 1. Handle the challenge message in the body and send it back to twitch
  - 2. When we receive the actual messaging, then do the things you want!
- Show how to use the Twitch CLI to test
- Before Twitch can use this, we need to register our EventSub for the event we're listening for
