We're going to combine two services: Netlify and Twitch! When a user goes
online, we're going to launch a Netlify function. This could really could do
anything that we want, but for this example, I will have it just `console.log` the
payload we get from Twitch!

If you want to just see the code, feel free to take a gander at the repo.

## Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes a few things:
- You have a Netlify account
- You have a Twitch account
- You have Node.js installed

You will need both accounts in order for you to launch any functions.

## Building the Netlify Function

In our project directory, we're going to build out a nested folder:
1. At the root level `netlify`
2. And inside of the `netlify` folder, `functions`

<Callout>
  We're doing this because Netlify offers zero configuration options
  for functions if you have a structure of `netlify/functions/<name_of_functions>`.
  Netlify will be smart enough to recognize how it is supposed to interpet it!
</Callout>

Now let's create a file in our `netlify/functions` folder called `log.js`.

```js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  // Everything in here will be invoked when Twitch connects
}
```

In the Twitch EventSub documentation for step 5, it oulines that before
we receive any subscriptions we need to be able to handle the challenge
response. This is typically what I write first for my functions:

```js {6}
const VERIFICATION_TYPE = "webhook_callback_verification"
exports.handler = async (event) => {

  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)

  const messageType = event.headers["twitch-eventsub-message-type"];

  if(messageType === VERIFICATION_TYPE) {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: body.challenge // IMPORTANT, challenge is a key in body
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice with the hightlighted line that we parse out the type of
message we receive from Twitch. Things like verification, revoking,
or the actual subscription payload will be deteremined with this.

From here, once we're verified, we will need to be able to handle the `notification`
type which says what ever we've been subscribed to is sending us a payload. This is
where the magic will mostly happen for us!

```js {2,14-23}
const VERIFICATION_TYPE = "webhook_callback_verification"
const NOTIFICATION_TYPE = "notification"
exports.handler = async (event) => {

  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)

  const messageType = event.headers["twitch-eventsub-message-type"];

  if(messageType === VERIFICATION_TYPE) {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: body.challenge // IMPORTANT, challenge is a key in body
    }
  } else if(messageType === NOTIFICATION_TYPE) {
    const event = body.event
    
    console.log("Twitch activated this webhook! Here's the payload: ", event)

    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: "ok"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Function Locally with CLIs

This step is optional but I recommend it since you can save a lot of
time without deploying and waiting for each service to be ready! We
can setup our netlify functions with the Netlify CLI. In
the project root, we run in the Terminal:

```bash
netlify dev
```

This should run the Netlify local server at the default route of `http://localhost:8888`.

From there we can run the Twitch CLI to test both the verification step
and the notification step.

When we want to test our verification of our EventSub:

```bash
twitch event verify-subscription -F http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/log streamup
```

This should output to the terminal:

```bash
✔ Valid response. Received challenge 9e5ad6d4-e82a-6901-3c08-ce2a7855555b in body
✔ Valid status code. Received status 200
```

And when we want to test if our hook will operate properly we can use the Twitch CLI
once again:

```bash
twitch event trigger -F http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/log streamup
```

And that should result with a `200`:

```bash
2000/08/30 20:41:12 [200] Request Sent
# ... A mock JSON response from Twitch
```

### Publish the Netlify Function

Now we're should be ready to publish our Netlify Function! You can
use whatever process works for you but I enjoy using the Netlify
CLI because in my terminal I run:

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

And then it will give my the live link!

### Setting up the Twitch EventSub Subscription

Now with our deployed Netlify Function we can subscribe to the EventSub.
Similar to Netlify, you can use the Twitch CLI to make it so much easier!

Make sure you configure your Twitch CLI with an application and request
your application token with `twitch token`.

And then we'll be able to set up our twitch subscription with:

```bash
twitch api post eventsub/subscription --body '{
"type": "stream.online",
  "version": "1",                      
  "condition": {                       
      "broadcaster_user_id": "20127229"
  },                      
  "transport": {                                                                          
      "method": "webhook",                                                                
      "callback": "https://mystifying-hamilton-ecdbc9.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/log",
      "secret": "this_is_my_secret_password"                                                    
  }
}'
```

The things highlighted represent the things you should notice:
- the `type` allows you to connect to different EventSub types
- `condition` has different ways you can be more specific on when this should run.
In our case, we're wanting to run whenever our broadcaster_id goes online
- `callback` which is the live link to our netlify function
- `secret` is _crucial_ to making sure that Twitch can verify it is your code that is invoking this function

And that's a wrap! If you want to verify if your subscription is all setup:

```bash
twitch api get eventsub/subscriptions
```

And you should see it in the list!
